        'The Tagoe brothers fondly remember their Beach BarBQ weekend parties with friends and family. While they danced to the pulsating beats and rhythms from the Ghetto Blaster, their father stood at the grill and prepared his legendary funky chicken and fish recipes.',

'In addition, there were the Tagoes highly sought-after homemade soft drink creations, made from fresh coconuts, pineapple, ginger, watermelon and bananas and whatever was available and what the heart desired - served ice cold, their sodas were the indispensable highlight of each of these magical unforgettable moments.',

'After the resounding success of their first range of drinks, DjuDju beer, the Tagoe family decided to take the next step in their mission: to combine tradition with modern technology and offer the world their exciting old, new beverage experiences.',

'They finally decided to give in to the popular demand and transform their widely acclaimed fruit soda mixes with sunshine and music into real bottled lemonades. After many years of trying, experimenting and endless fun with family and friends',
